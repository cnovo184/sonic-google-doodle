# My Topic Google Doodle

My Classic-Sonic Google Doodle animation is a vibrant, interactive stage featuring classic elements from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The animation includes various SVG images like terrain, trees, flowers, and spikes, which are essential elements of the Sonic game environment.

The animation uses GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create dynamic movements. Each letter of the word "Google" moves 50 pixels on both the x and y axes, with a staggered start time of 0.2 seconds for each letter. This movement is continuous, creating a lively and engaging animation.
